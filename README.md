This is the game Hunt The Wumpus written in Haskell. This project was completed for my Language Study class. Many parts of the game are missing considering the time we had to complete the assignment was limited, and thus, those parts were not required. The game prompts are not very descriptive and the code is extremely ugly, so I may decide to clean up the code and add classic game functions in the future. But for now, the Wumpus spawns in a random room and moves to one of its adjacent rooms if you shoot an arrow and miss. There are no pits or bats.
